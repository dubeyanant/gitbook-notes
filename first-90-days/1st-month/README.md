# 1st Month

For the first month of my internship, I will segment this part into four pages, which will be based on four weeks. Each week, I'll write about five weekdays. Each day, I'll try to write about what happened that day, my observations, tasks, and learnings.

Simultaneously, I'll write about other changes I'm making that somehow relate to my job.

Below, I've written some pointers, after researching the topic as a first-time working professional, that you can treat as "_things to know while at work_":

## 37 Commandments for Work

1. **Punctuality Matters:** Being punctual is crucial in the professional world. Arriving on time shows respect for your colleagues' time and sets a positive impression. Aim to be at least 15 minutes early to demonstrate your commitment and readiness for the workday.
2. **Intelligence Check:** Avoid the "curse of intelligence" by assuming your understanding of a problem is complete. Investigate and familiarize yourself with the company's history to ensure that the issues you're addressing haven't already been dealt with or are part of an ongoing strategy.
3. **Quality Over Speed:** Prioritize the quality of your work over speed. Rushing through tasks can lead to errors and oversights. Take the time to ensure your work is accurate and meets the required standards.
4. **Own Your Mistakes:** Taking responsibility for your mistakes is essential. Don't assume that others will catch and rectify errors. Acknowledge your missteps and take proactive steps to correct them.
5. **Doubt Resolution:** When in doubt, seek clarification. Avoid making assumptions that can lead to misunderstandings. Asking questions demonstrates your commitment to understanding and getting things right.
6. **Authenticity Over Pleasing:** Focus on delivering quality work rather than trying to please everybody. Authenticity in your efforts will earn respect and recognition.
7. **Office Politics Detox:** Refrain from getting involved in office politics. Maintain a neutral and professional stance to avoid unnecessary conflicts and distractions.
8. **Gossip-Free Zone:** Steer clear of gossip and negative discussions. Building trust takes time, and speaking negatively about others can harm relationships and your professional reputation.
9. **Opinion Restraint:** Exercise restraint in sharing personal opinions in your first few days. Take time to understand the culture and dynamics of the workplace before expressing strong viewpoints.
10. **Outcome-Oriented:** Don't focus solely on immediate output. Consider the long-term outcomes and impact of your work on the organization's goals and objectives.
11. **Time-Off Timing:** Delay booking time off in your first few days to establish your presence and commitment to your new role.
12. **Modesty Matters:** Refrain from showing off your achievements. Share information about your accomplishments only when asked or when the context naturally arises.
13. **Don’t Complain:** Complaining relinquishes control over your life decisions. Instead of complaining, focus on finding solutions and addressing issues constructively.
14. **Keep It Professional:** Avoid getting too familiar with colleagues in your first few days. Maintain a professional distance while you observe and understand the office dynamics.
15. **Culture Alignment:** If you observe actions or behaviours inconsistent with the company's culture, raise your voice.
16. **Salary Realism:** Instead of assuming your desired salary, research market rates for your role. This ensures realistic expectations and facilitates informed salary negotiations.
17. **Promotion Path:** Merely working hard may not guarantee promotion. Ask about the specific steps and criteria required for career advancement within the company.
18. **Dress for Success:** Presenting yourself in a smart and professional outfit sets a positive first impression, showcasing your commitment to the workplace and respect for the professional environment.
19. **Hygiene Check:** Personal hygiene is a crucial aspect of professionalism. Ensure you present yourself in a clean and well-groomed manner to uphold a positive image in the workplace.
20. **Positive First Impressions:** Greet everyone with a warm smile, a firm handshake, and direct eye contact. This establishes a friendly and confident presence, fostering positive relationships with colleagues.
21. **Team Familiarity:** Take the time to get to know your team members by learning their names and understanding their roles. This demonstrates your interest in collaboration and builds a sense of camaraderie.
22. **Cross-Departmental Connections:** Go beyond your immediate department and connect with colleagues from other departments. Having lunch with someone new each day fosters a broader understanding of the organization and facilitates networking.
23. **Inquisitive Attitude:** Demonstrate your curiosity by asking questions and actively taking notes. This not only shows your eagerness to learn but also helps you retain valuable information.
24. **Feedback Initiative:** Take the initiative to seek feedback actively. Pose specific questions to receive meaningful insights rather than general responses, enhancing your understanding of expectations and areas for improvement.
25. **Role Expectations:** Gain clarity on your role by asking your manager about specific expectations. This ensures alignment with organizational goals and provides a clear roadmap for your professional development.
26. **Policy Awareness:** Familiarize yourself with company policies and procedures by asking your manager about the essential rules to follow. Adhering to these guidelines demonstrates your commitment to organizational standards.
27. **Organized Workspace:** Organize your desk or working environment to create an efficient and productive workspace. A well-organized space reflects attention to detail and contributes to a positive work atmosphere.
28. **S.M.A.R.T. Goals:** Establish SMART goals for yourself—goals that are Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, and Timely. This strategic approach helps guide your efforts and measure your success.
29. **Trustworthy Performance:** Maintain trust by consistently delivering high-quality work. Poor performance can erode trust, so ensure your contributions meet or exceed expectations.
30. **Social Engagement:** Accept social invitations such as lunch or coffee breaks. Participating in these activities fosters a positive work culture and builds relationships with colleagues.
31. **Listening Over Impressing:** Prioritize active listening and continuous learning during the first 90 days. Rather than trying to impress, absorb information, and hone your skills to contribute meaningfully in the future.
32. **Observe, Learn, Adapt:** Take the time to research, skill up, and observe the company culture. Listening, observing, and taking notes enable you to adapt effectively to the organization's dynamics.
33. **Understand People and Processes:** Document details about how people communicate and work. This includes understanding the company's culture. Detailed notes aid in adapting to the work environment and avoiding unnecessary misunderstandings.
34. **Proactive Updates:** Proactively update colleagues on the progress of your work. If there are delays, inform them promptly. This open communication fosters transparency and builds trust.
35. **Respectful Conduct:** Maintain a respectful attitude towards everyone, irrespective of their role. Treating colleagues with respect contributes to a positive and inclusive workplace culture.
36. **Indispensable Contribution:** Aim to be indispensable by consistently delivering your best work. Actively seek feedback to identify areas for improvement and continually refine your skills to add significant value.
37. **Learn from Mistakes:** Acknowledge and apologize for any mistakes you make. Learn from these experiences and take proactive measures to avoid repeating the same errors. This demonstrates accountability and a commitment to growth.
