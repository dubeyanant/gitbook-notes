# ðŸ™‚ Week 3

## Day 1

### Observations

A new local station has opened near my working area, and I have to walk around 1 km to reach my building from the station. After walking for more than 7,000 steps, I feel like walking isn't as bad as it sounds.

### Learnings

Get bored. Because boredom nurtures creativity, innovation, and mastery.

### Misc.

Well, there has been this thing going on for a few days where I am planning a lot of things to do but don't have enough resources to execute them. There are a lot of things.

Also, I want to remind myself of my goals, because sometimes it is necessary to remind yourself.

* Read more.
* Exercise.
* Maintain a sleep schedule.
* Grow professionally.
* Start building an online presence.
* Meditation.
