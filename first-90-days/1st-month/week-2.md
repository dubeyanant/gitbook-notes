# ðŸ‘€ Week 2

## Day 1

### What happened?

I joined the daily stand-up call for 35 minutes. Then I had a one-on-one call with TL, got some tasks done, got an evening call, and wrapped up. This was a very standard technical learning day.

### Observations

One thing that I've observed today is that having a well-planned structure for whatever you're doing helps a lot. Let me explain: till date, I was following a roadmap that was structured per say, but I had to find relevant Flutter documents and videos to learn from. But on the weekends, I bought a well-structured course on Flutter taught by a well-established person. And as soon as I started learning, I could see the difference between the two approaches. If I can, from now on, I'll choose the latter one.

### Tasks

* [x] Learn Flutter fundamentals.

### Learnings

Getting a mentor or a teacher is a cheat code to becoming successful in life.

### Misc.

I am trying to budget my expenses.
