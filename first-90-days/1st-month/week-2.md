# ðŸ‘€ Week 2

## Day 1

### What happened?

I joined the daily stand-up call for 35 minutes. Then I had a one-on-one call with TL, got some tasks done, got an evening call, and wrapped up. This was a very standard technical learning day.

### Observations

One thing that I've observed today is that having a well-planned structure for whatever you're doing helps a lot. Let me explain: till date, I was following a roadmap that was structured per say, but I had to find relevant Flutter documents and videos to learn from. But on the weekends, I bought a well-structured course on Flutter taught by a well-established person. And as soon as I started learning, I could see the difference between the two approaches. If I can, from now on, I'll choose the latter one.

### Tasks

* [x] Learn Flutter fundamentals.

### Learnings

Getting a mentor or a teacher is a cheat code to becoming successful in life.

### Misc.

I am trying to budget my expenses.

## Day 2

### What happened?

I went to the office, got my desktop, but couldn't set it up because I didn't have appropriate internet access rights. After that, I did my other learning tasks and came back.

### Observations

I saw the application testing team today; their environment was a little bit different than ours, and they were talking in different terms. But seeing them made me realize that there are many different small parts in a car, but every part is required to run it smoothly.

### Tasks

* [ ] Desktop setup.
* [x] More technical learning.

### Learnings

Keep it simple. The more convoluted it gets, the more brain power it takes. Keep it simple as long as you can.

When you are allowed the freedom to do something on your own, there are a lot of ways to go about doing it. However, you can only make the best decision if you have specific objectives in mind; otherwise, you will let your thoughts roam and become distracted.

### Misc.

I'm hoping for better days.
