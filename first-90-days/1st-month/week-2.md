# ðŸ‘€ Week 2

## Day 1

### What happened?

I joined the daily stand-up call for 35 minutes. Then I had a one-on-one call with TL, got some tasks done, got an evening call, and wrapped up. This was a very standard technical learning day.

### Observations

One thing that I've observed today is that having a well-planned structure for whatever you're doing helps a lot. Let me explain: till date, I was following a roadmap that was structured per say, but I had to find relevant Flutter documents and videos to learn from. But on the weekends, I bought a well-structured course on Flutter taught by a well-established person. And as soon as I started learning, I could see the difference between the two approaches. If I can, from now on, I'll choose the latter one.

### Tasks

* [x] Learn Flutter fundamentals.

### Learnings

Getting a mentor or a teacher is a cheat code to becoming successful in life.

### Misc.

I am trying to budget my expenses.

## Day 2

### What happened?

I went to the office, got my desktop, but couldn't set it up because I didn't have appropriate internet access rights. After that, I did my other learning tasks and came back.

### Observations

I saw the application testing team today; their environment was a little bit different than ours, and they were talking in different terms. But seeing them made me realize that there are many different small parts in a car, but every part is required to run it smoothly.

### Tasks

* [ ] Desktop setup.
* [x] More technical learning.

### Learnings

Keep it simple. The more convoluted it gets, the more brain power it takes. Keep it simple as long as you can.

When you are allowed the freedom to do something on your own, there are a lot of ways to go about doing it. However, you can only make the best decision if you have specific objectives in mind; otherwise, you will let your thoughts roam and become distracted.

### Misc.

I'm hoping for better days.

## Day 3

### What happened?

I completed one more project.

### Observations

My TL recently gave me some questions that weren't directly related to my current tasks. However, I realized that experience has a way of imparting valuable lessons. It teaches you not only how to challenge others but also how to consistently place them in mildly challenging situations, fostering their ability to overcome obstacles and facilitate personal growth.

### Tasks

* [x] Complete an ongoing section.

### Learnings

Dumber people make more money than smart people because they continue to do things that smart people consider risky because they understand the gravity of the situation, whereas dumb people do not. So they keep doing it until they are successful.

### Misc.

Today, I moved into a new flat, which is identical to the previous one but one floor lower. I live with one more roommate. I spent the majority of my time cleaning and organizing things in this flat.

## Day 4

### What happened?

I went to the office and did my learning. It's my learning phase going on.

### Observations

My team didn't come, so I was sitting alone in the office. And I noticed no one was asking me how's the work or anything else like this. Then I realized that everyone is alone in their world, and its high time that we approach people, say a nice hello, and maybe even genuinely compliment them.

### Tasks

* [x] Continue learning more technical stuff

### Learnings

Remember that sometimes the simple act of focusing on your breath and touching grass can have awesome benefits.

### Misc.

I visited the central park, and it was nice. The whole park was big, with so many different areas to explore. It was nice sitting there for 15 minutes.
