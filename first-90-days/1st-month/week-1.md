# ðŸ™ˆ Week 1

## Day 1

### What happened?

I attended a meeting today with my seniors and colleagues. At the end of the meeting, there was a casual introduction of my seniors first, and then I introduced myself. After that, I got a task allotted for today.

In the evening, I had another call with my senior. He followed up on what I did the whole day and gave me some more tasks.

### Observations

This quote was the first thing I remembered after attending my first meeting with managers, seniors, and colleagues.

There is so much going on, but I am glad that I know that I don't know most of it. With a broad mind, I'm willing to tackle challenges that come my way.

I can see that the meetings are Scrum-based, and I need to learn more about it in depth. The second thing I notice is the office lingo; there are so many words that I do not understand. I need to work on these things for a few days.

### Tasks

**Learn about the fundamentals of the Dart programming language:**

* [x] Basics of Dart and the Flutter
* [ ] Variables
  * [x] Types of Variables
  * [ ] Variable Methods
  * [x] Null Safety
  * [x] Late Variables
* [x] Built-in Types
* [x] Operators
* [x] Control flow statements

### Learnings

Seeing something new is like scratching the surface. At first, you only catch a glimpse. To truly understand, you've got to dig deeperâ€”learn, explore, or hear from others. There's always more beneath the first look.

### Misc.

The first thing I did was schedule my calendar to optimize my timing for commutes, office hours, meetings, sleep, and other important things.

I am searching for a place to shift in Navi Mumbai.

## Day 2

### What happened?

The day started with a daily stand-up call, which ran for 45 minutes, and then I gave updates to my mentor or manager (I don't know yet). After giving updates, I got my task allotted, and a mid-day call was scheduled.

In the mid-day call, a similar thing happened, where I gave an update, got feedback, and got some new tasks.

On the last call of the day, I gave updates and got a task for two days later because I have HR induction tomorrow.

### Observations

The daily call moved quickly, with no time spent other than providing updates on all the progress being made, assigning new tasks to everyone, and concluding the meeting. I am learning firsthand how a group of more than ten people collaborate to create a product, as well as how each person interacts and completes their assigned tasks. When I physically join the office, I will explore this further.

I also noticed that the seniors are kind to me and treat me well, even if they are occupied or engaged in other activities.

I would like to share a quote with you all that I remembered while finishing my tasks:

### Tasks

**Backlogs:**

* [x] Variables
  * [x] Variable Methods

**Complete the fundamentals of the Dart programming language.**

* [x] IO
* [x] OOP in Dart
* [ ] Functions
  * [x] Named Parameters
  * [x] Optional Positional Parameters
  * [ ] Anonymous Scope
  * [ ] Lexical Scope and Closures

**Start with the Flutter framework:**

* [x] Stateless and stateful Widgets

### Learnings

In between learning new things, experiencing new environments, and many more of my feelings, which cannot be put into words, I am learning to have patience.

### Misc.

This city is hot, humid, and very populated; hence, I'm not liking it very much, but I hope that this will pass with time.

When my working hours ended, I went looking for apartments and P.G., which I did not really like. There is not a lot of room in these rooms. I am still searching for somewhere to shift.
