# ðŸ™ˆ Week 1

## Day 1

### What happened?

I attended a meeting today with my seniors and colleagues. At the end of the meeting, there was a casual introduction of my seniors first, and then I introduced myself. After that, I got a task allotted for today.

### Observations

This quote was the first thing I remembered after attending my first meeting with managers, seniors, and colleagues.

There is so much going on, but I am glad that I know that I don't know most of it. With a broad mind, I'm willing to tackle challenges that come my way.

I can see that the meetings are Scrum-based, and I need to learn more about it in depth. The second thing I notice is the office lingo; there are so many words that I do not understand. I need to work on these things for a few days.

### Tasks

Learn about the technology that the team is working on.

* [x] I learned about the very basics.

### Learnings

* Seeing something new is like scratching the surface. At first, you only catch a glimpse. To truly understand, you've got to dig deeperâ€”learn, explore, or hear from others. There's always more beneath the first look.

### Misc.

#### Daily life

I am searching for a place to shift in Navi Mumbai.

#### Changes

The first thing I did was schedule my calendar to optimize my timing for commutes, office hours, meetings, sleep, and other important things.
