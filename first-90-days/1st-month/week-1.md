# ðŸ™ˆ Week 1

## Day 1

### What happened?

I attended a meeting today with my seniors and colleagues. At the end of the meeting, there was a casual introduction of my seniors first, and then I introduced myself. After that, I got a task allotted for today.

In the evening, I had another call with my senior. He followed up on what I did the whole day and gave me some more tasks.

### Observations

This quote was the first thing I remembered after attending my first meeting with managers, seniors, and colleagues.

> <mark style="color:green;">I know that I know nothing.</mark> \~ Socrates

There is so much going on, but I am glad that I know that I don't know most of it. With a broad mind, I'm willing to tackle challenges that come my way.

I can see that the meetings are Scrum-based, and I need to learn more about it in depth. The second thing I notice is the office lingo; there are so many words that I do not understand. I need to work on these things for a few days.

### Tasks

**Learn about the fundamentals of the Dart programming language:**

* [x] Basics of Dart and the Flutter
* [ ] Variables
  * [x] Types of Variables
  * [ ] Variable Methods
  * [x] Null Safety
  * [x] Late Variables
* [x] Built-in Types
* [x] Operators
* [x] Control flow statements

### Learnings

Seeing something new is like scratching the surface. At first, you only catch a glimpse. To truly understand, you've got to dig deeperâ€”learn, explore, or hear from others. There's always more beneath the first look.

### Misc.

The first thing I did was schedule my calendar to optimize my timing for commutes, office hours, meetings, sleep, and other important things.

I am searching for a place to shift in Navi Mumbai.

## Day 2

### What happened?

The day started with a daily stand-up call, which ran for 45 minutes, and then I gave updates to my mentor or manager (I don't know yet). After giving updates, I got my task allotted, and a mid-day call was scheduled.

In the mid-day call, a similar thing happened, where I gave an update, got feedback, and got some new tasks.

On the last call of the day, I gave updates and got a task for two days later because I have HR induction tomorrow.

### Observations

The daily call moved quickly, with no time spent other than providing updates on all the progress being made, assigning new tasks to everyone, and concluding the meeting. I am learning firsthand how a group of more than ten people collaborate to create a product, as well as how each person interacts and completes their assigned tasks. When I physically join the office, I will explore this further.

I also noticed that the seniors are kind to me and treat me well, even if they are occupied or engaged in other activities.

I would like to share a quote with you all that I remembered while finishing my tasks:

### Tasks

**Backlogs:**

* [x] Variables
  * [x] Variable Methods

**Complete the fundamentals of the Dart programming language.**

* [x] IO
* [x] OOP in Dart
* [ ] Functions
  * [x] Named Parameters
  * [x] Optional Positional Parameters
  * [ ] Anonymous Scope
  * [ ] Lexical Scope and Closures

**Start with the Flutter framework:**

* [x] Stateless and stateful Widgets

### Learnings

In between learning new things, experiencing new environments, and many more of my feelings, which cannot be put into words, I am learning to have patience.

### Misc.

This city is hot, humid, and very populated; hence, I'm not liking it very much, but I hope that this will pass with time.

When my working hours ended, I went looking for apartments and P.G., which I did not really like. There is not a lot of room in these rooms. I am still searching for somewhere to shift.

## Day 3

### What happened?

I went to the office for the first timeâ€”well, not actually the first time. (I went there once for a hackathon, which led me to this internship in the first place.) and I reached 35 minutes earlier.

HR induction started and finished on time, which ran for a total of 7 or 8 hours, including lunch and other breaks.

Induction had several different modules, explaining general policies, company policies, employee benefits, etc. There were several interactions at this event; some quizzes and questions were thrown at us to tackle.

When the induction got over, I came back to my stay.

### Observations

As I arrived early, I could feel that it was a positive start, as I didn't have the tension of arriving late, which I usually do. I felt in control.

The office infrastructure is quite good, and I like the place. Today was HR induction, and I didn't have a full feel for working with co-workers and managers, but I still got to explore the office. Seeing so many people working at the same place was a bit overwhelming at first, but I think I'll get used to it pretty quickly.

As the HR explained, I liked what I heard. The culture is good, and I got to know a lot of new things today. During this time, I got to meet so many new people from various different departments like sales, customer service, HR, etc. who came there for induction. Maybe I'll not see some of them after the induction gets over, but it's just a nice feeling when you meet someone new and get to know there field of work and how they operate.

### Tasks

There were no tasks for today.

### Learnings

I got to know how rules and regulations work in a big organization. How the top executive thinks and what goes into running such a company from a non-technical perspective.

And from the fun side, I got to learn two new things as well. 1. Why Michael hates Toby. 2. My bladder can't handle the AC.

### Misc.

I am trying to establish an 8-hour sleep schedule from the start of this year, from 11 to 7. The reasoning behind this is that, since a job that is fixed into my routine takes up 8.5 hours of my day, why not create a fixed routine to see where my time goes and what else I can accomplish with it?

My goal is not to accomplish more in the time I have, but rather to aspire to something similar to what Cal Newport suggests in [this](https://youtu.be/0G7Wu4DnDaw?si=OBI2-DngLqtjjC2b) video.

Did I mention to you the [goals](https://x.com/\_aanant/status/1741183875743985981?s=20) I hope to accomplish this year?

* Start working out
* Start mediation
* Read more
* Grow professionally
* Start building my personal online brand and value.
* Maintain a consistent sleep schedule

And, when I talk about goals, I know that it'll take time to build each one of these habits, because every goal in here is a [keystone habit](https://jamesclear.com/keystone-habits) and even if I achieve one of them, it can transform my life in a positive manner. When I talk about building these habits and achieving certain goals, I try to abide by this quote:

Here is my photo at the end of the day, with all the stars you can see:

## Day 4

### What happened?

I arrived at work and had a meeting with every member of my team's hierarchy, from my incredibly talented team leader to the company's serene CIO. I had one-on-one conversations with each person and learned so much about my position and the business.

My manager, team lead and I had breakfast together. They were friendly and offered me their breakfast.

I was forced to use my personal laptop since my official desktop and laptop were still being configured.

Then, my team lead and a few other coworkers and I had lunch. After that, I completed my assignment, had a one-on-one discussion with the manager of my manager, and wrapped up my workstation.

### Observations

My manager and his managers were very welcoming, as was every member of the team, including my colleagues, who were all very cool and welcoming. One thing I found really nice is that no one is micromanaged by a superior. Although this was my first day, I believe this is how the team functions.

An additional thing I learned is that the team does not follow the scrum methodology. Therefore, my prior assumptions were incorrect. The group uses SVN as well. I gave many lectures to many people on Git and GitHub, but now I'll have to learn SVN, but learning something new is what I like to do!

### Tasks

* [x] Setup Flutter ecosystem

### Learnings

I learned today not to assume anything; if you just clear up any doubts you have right away, everyone will be satisfied.

Secondly, do not wait to demonstrate your progress because you believe it will have a greater impact if you do so. Demonstrate your progress as you make it, since those who are monitoring your work form opinions over time. Do not wait to think things through until you show them your work.

Last but not least, have conversations with individuals in various departments and teams. This will allow you to gain perspectives that you would not be able to obtain by confining yourself to a single location.

### Misc.

I tried to refine my weekday routine.

## Day 5

### What happened?

This morning, something unusual happenedâ€”I got stuck at the gate because I didn't have a valid ID to enter the premises. I called my team lead, and in no time, he was with me. Within a few minutes, I obtained the security pass. So, it was a unique experience.

In the office, I initially worked on a learning project to grasp how Flutter functions, and afterward, I started the assignment given to me. By the end of the day, I showed the completed assignment, received feedback, and then headed back to my room.

### Observations

My seniors talk to me very nicely, and I don't feel like they are very different from me in knowledge because they don't show it; they show modesty, but I know they are very experienced people because I got to know how many years they have been working on the technology.

Another thing I noticed is that my lead fosters growth and learning; without directly telling me how to solve something, he encourages me to find answers.

### Tasks

* [x] Build one front-end login screen

### Learnings

The simplicity of talking with anyone at any level is magical, especially if you are superior to others. The magic happens when people don't perceive that you are on a different level, even if they know you are at a different level.

### Misc.

I am feeling less tired today.
