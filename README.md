# First 90 Days

The idea of writing about my first 90 days of internship came from the book [The First 90 Days](https://amzn.eu/d/8I3QZqH) by Michael D. Watkins.

In these notes, I'll write about my observations and learnings from my first internship. Also, one of the major parts of these notes will be about my transformations on a day-to-day basis after joining corporate life.

One more thing is that <mark style="color:red;">I'll try not to go into detail while writing about any of the topics so as to maintain the company's privacy and integrity</mark>.

Here, I want to talk more about the book so as to record my learnings and give readers an idea of what the book presents.
